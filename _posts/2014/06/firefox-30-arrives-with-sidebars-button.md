Mozilla today officially launched Firefox 30 for Windows, Mac, Linux, and Android. Additions include a button for direct access to sidebars (social, bookmark, and history), support for GStreamer 1.0, and new quickshare buttons in the context menu on Android.

Firefox 30 has been released over on Firefox.com and all existing users should be able to upgrade to it automatically. As always, the Android version is trickling out slowly on Google Play.

In terms of new features, this is a relatively minor release, especially when compared to the major revamp that came as part of Firefox 29. Mozilla has been mainly focusing on putting the final touches on what it calls "the most carefully designed browser interface on the planet."
