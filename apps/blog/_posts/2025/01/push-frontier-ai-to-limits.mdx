# Pushing Frontier AI to Its Limits

As an engineer, I'm always looking for ways to improve my workflow. Over the past year, I've extensively tested various AI coding tools. This post shares my findings with interactive components you can explore.

## Tool Comparison

Here's how I rate the top AI coding assistants:

<ToolComparison
  name="Claude (Anthropic)"
  rating={5}
  winner={true}
  pros={[
    "Exceptional at complex reasoning",
    "Great at understanding context",
    "Follows instructions precisely",
    "Strong coding capabilities"
  ]}
  cons={[
    "Knowledge cutoff limitations",
    "Can be verbose at times",
    "Rate limits on free tier"
  ]}
  description="Claude has become my go-to AI assistant for coding tasks. Its ability to understand complex requirements and produce clean, well-documented code is unmatched. The Claude Code CLI integration makes it seamless to use in my development workflow."
/>

<ToolComparison
  name="GitHub Copilot"
  rating={4}
  pros={[
    "Excellent IDE integration",
    "Fast inline completions",
    "Good for boilerplate code"
  ]}
  cons={[
    "Less accurate for complex logic",
    "Limited context window",
    "Subscription required"
  ]}
  description="Copilot is great for day-to-day coding tasks, especially for completing repetitive patterns. However, for more complex architectural decisions, I still prefer Claude."
/>

## Feature Comparison Matrix

Let me break down the features across different tools:

<FeatureMatrix
  tools={["Claude", "Copilot", "Cursor", "Cody"]}
  features={[
    {
      featureName: "Code Understanding",
      scores: [
        { toolName: "Claude", score: 5, explanation: "Best-in-class context understanding" },
        { toolName: "Copilot", score: 3, explanation: "Limited context window" },
        { toolName: "Cursor", score: 4, explanation: "Good with codebase indexing" },
        { toolName: "Cody", score: 4, explanation: "Strong with Sourcegraph integration" }
      ]
    },
    {
      featureName: "Code Generation",
      scores: [
        { toolName: "Claude", score: 5 },
        { toolName: "Copilot", score: 4 },
        { toolName: "Cursor", score: 4 },
        { toolName: "Cody", score: 3 }
      ]
    },
    {

        { toolName: "Copilot", score: 2, explanation: "Single file focus" },
        { toolName: "Cursor", score: 4, explanation: "Good multi-file support" },
        { toolName: "Cody", score: 3 }
      ]
    },
    {
      featureName: "IDE Integration",
      scores: [
        { toolName: "Claude", score: 3, explanation: "CLI-focused" },
        { toolName: "Copilot", score: 5, explanation: "Native VS Code integration" },
        { toolName: "Cursor", score: 5, explanation: "Built as an IDE" },
        { toolName: "Cody", score: 4 }
      ]
    }

    {
      id: "plan",
      icon: "Lightbulb",
      title: "Plan",
      description: "Use Claude to break down the task into smaller steps. Discuss architecture decisions and potential pitfalls before writing any code."
    },
    {
      id: "implement",
      icon: "Code",
      title: "Implement",
      description: "Write code with AI assistance. Claude Code helps with complex logic while Copilot handles boilerplate and completions."
    },
    {

## Conclusion

AI coding tools have fundamentally changed how I approach software development. The key is finding the right tool for each task:

- **Complex reasoning & architecture**: Claude
- **Quick completions & boilerplate**: Copilot (still useful)
- **Full workflow automation**: Claude Code CLI
