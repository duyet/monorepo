# Pushing Frontier AI to Its Limits

As an engineer, I'm always looking for ways to improve my workflow. Over the past year, I've extensively tested various AI coding tools. This post shares my findings with interactive components you can explore.

## Tool Comparison

Here's how I rate the top AI coding assistants:

<ToolComparison
  name="Claude (Anthropic)"
  rating={5}
  winner={true}
  pros={[
    "Exceptional at complex reasoning",
    "Great at understanding context",
    "Follows instructions precisely",
    "Strong coding capabilities"
  ]}
  cons={[
    "Knowledge cutoff limitations",
    "Can be verbose at times",
    "Rate limits on free tier"
  ]}
  description="Claude has become my go-to AI assistant for coding tasks. Its ability to understand complex requirements and produce clean, well-documented code is unmatched. The Claude Code CLI integration makes it seamless to use in my development workflow."
/>

<ToolComparison
  name="GitHub Copilot"
  rating={4}
  pros={[
    "Excellent IDE integration",
    "Fast inline completions",
    "Good for boilerplate code"
  ]}
  cons={[
    "Less accurate for complex logic",
    "Limited context window",

## My AI Development Workflow

Here's how I integrate AI tools into my development process:

<Tabs
  tabs={[
    {
      id: "plan",
      label: "Plan",
      content: (
        <div className="space-y-4">
          <p className="text-base text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
            <strong>Use Claude to break down the task into smaller steps.</strong> This is where I invest the most time with AI. I discuss:
          </p>
          <ul className="space-y-2 ml-4 text-sm text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400">
            <li>• Architecture decisions and design patterns</li>
            <li>• Potential pitfalls and edge cases</li>
            <li>• Technology stack and dependency choices</li>
            <li>• Testing strategy and error handling</li>
            <li>• Performance and scalability concerns</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="text-sm text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-500">
            This phase prevents costly mistakes and ensures a solid foundation before writing any code.
          </p>
        </div>
      )
    },
    {
      id: "implement",

          <ul className="space-y-2 ml-4 text-sm text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400">
            <li>• Spot bugs and potential runtime errors</li>
            <li>• Improve performance and reduce complexity</li>
            <li>• Ensure best practices and project standards are followed</li>
            <li>• Identify edge cases and error scenarios</li>
            <li>• Check for security vulnerabilities</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="text-sm text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-500">
            This automated review catches issues before they reach production.
