# MDX Components Showcase

Welcome to this comprehensive guide showcasing all 7 interactive MDX components available for use in our blog posts. These components are designed to enhance content creation by providing rich, interactive elements that engage readers.

## Overview

Our MDX support allows you to use React components directly in your markdown files, enabling:

- Interactive data visualizations
- Component-based UIs within content
- Rich comparisons and analyses
- Real-time user interaction

Let's explore each component with practical examples.

---

## 1. ToolComparison

The ToolComparison component helps you compare multiple tools side-by-side with interactive card selection.

```jsx
<ToolComparison tools={[
  {
    name: "VSCode",
    description: "Modern, extensible code editor",
    pros: ["Fast performance", "Huge extension ecosystem", "Free"],
    cons: ["Can be memory heavy", "Steep learning curve"],
    rating: 4.8
  },
  {
    name: "JetBrains IDE",
    description: "Professional-grade IDE suite",
    pros: ["Deep language intelligence", "Excellent refactoring tools"],
    cons: ["Paid subscription", "Resource intensive"],
    rating: 4.5
  }
]} />
```

<ToolComparison
  tools={[
    {
      name: "VSCode",
      description: "Modern, extensible code editor from Microsoft",
      pros: ["Fast performance", "Huge extension ecosystem", "Free and open-source", "Integrated terminal"],
      cons: ["Can be memory heavy", "Steep learning curve for beginners", "Limited built-in features"],
      rating: 4.8
    },
    {
      name: "JetBrains IDE",
      description: "Professional-grade IDE suite (PyCharm/WebStorm/IntelliJ)",
      pros: ["Deep language intelligence", "Excellent refactoring tools", "Built-in debugger", "Git integration"],
      cons: ["Paid subscription", "Resource intensive", "Slower startup"],
      rating: 4.5
    },
    {
      name: "Sublime Text",
      description: "Lightweight, fast text editor",
      pros: ["Blazing fast", "Minimalist UI", "Powerful search", "Cross-platform"],
      cons: ["Limited built-in features", "Plugin ecosystem smaller", "Requires license"],
      rating: 4.2
    }
  ]}
/>

## 2. FeatureMatrix

The FeatureMatrix creates a sortable table with color and shape-coded scoring.

```jsx
<FeatureMatrix
  features={[
    { name: "Speed", description: "Performance and load times" },
    { name: "UI", description: "User interface quality" },
    { name: "Features", description: "Built-in functionality" }
  ]}
  tools={[
    { name: "Tool A", scores: { Speed: 5, UI: 4, Features: 3 } },
    { name: "Tool B", scores: { Speed: 3, UI: 5, Features: 4 } }
  ]}
/>
```

<FeatureMatrix
  features={[
    { name: "Speed", description: "Performance and load times" },
    { name: "UI", description: "User interface quality" },
    { name: "Features", description: "Built-in functionality" },
    { name: "Documentation", description: "Help resources and guides" },
    { name: "Support", description: "Community and official support" }

      scores: { Speed: 5, UI: 4, Features: 5, Documentation: 5, Support: 5 },
      color: "bg-blue-500"
    },
    {
      name: "Vue",
      scores: { Speed: 4, UI: 5, Features: 4, Documentation: 5, Support: 4 },
      color: "bg-green-500"
    },
    {
      name: "Svelte",
      scores: { Speed: 5, UI: 4, Features: 3, Documentation: 4, Support: 3 },
      color: "bg-orange-500"
    },
    {
      name: "Angular",

## Benefits of MDX Components

Using these interactive components in your MDX posts provides:

- **Enhanced Engagement**: Readers can interact with content instead of passive reading
- **Better Data Visualization**: Complex information becomes easier to understand
- **Rich Comparisons**: Make informed decisions with interactive comparison tables
- **Progress Tracking**: Visualize workflows and completion status
- **Code Understanding**: Diff viewers make changes clear and readable

## Getting Started

To use these components in your MDX posts:

1. **MDX Files**: Save your posts with `.mdx` extension in the `_posts` directory
2. **Import Components**: Components are auto-imported (or explicitly import from `@duyet/components`)
3. **Use in Content**: Just use JSX syntax directly in your markdown
4. **Front Matter**: Use standard front matter for metadata

## Conclusion

MDX transforms static content into interactive experiences. Whether you're writing tutorials, documenting processes, or sharing data insights, these components help you create more engaging and effective content.

Try each component above to see how they enhance the reading experience!
