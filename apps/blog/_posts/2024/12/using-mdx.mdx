# Getting Started with MDX

Our blog now supports **MDX** (Markdown + JSX), which allows you to use React components directly in your markdown content.

## What is MDX?

MDX is a format that lets you seamlessly use JSX in your markdown documents. You can:

- Import and use React components
- Create interactive content
- Keep the simplicity of markdown for most content
- Enhance with custom components when needed

## Basic Markdown Still Works

This is still valid markdown:

- Lists work
- **Bold** and *italic* text
- `inline code`
- Links: [GitHub](https://github.com)

```javascript
// Code blocks still work
function hello(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}
```

## What's New

The MDX support includes:

1. **7 Interactive Components** for rich content
2. **Automatic .mdx file detection**
3. **Backward compatibility** with existing `.md` files
4. **KaTeX math rendering** (still works)

## Component Demo

Since full React component integration requires additional build-time processing, here's what the workflow looks like for using our MDX components:

```jsx
import { ToolComparison } from '@duyet/components';

<ToolComparison
  tools={[
    {
      name: "Tool A",
      description: "Great for beginners",
      pros: ["Easy to use", "Good docs"],
      cons: ["Limited features"],
      rating: 4.5
    }
  ]}
/>
```

This will render an interactive tool comparison card where readers can click and explore different tools.

## The 7 Components

1. **ToolComparison** - Interactive card-based tool comparison
2. **FeatureMatrix** - Sortable score matrix with color coding
3. **WakaTimeChart** - Stacked area chart for coding metrics
4. **ToolTimeline** - Horizontal/vertical timelines with statuses
5. **WorkflowDiagram** - Interactive workflow with dependencies
6. **VersionDiff** - Git-style diff viewer
7. **ToolList** - Searchable, filterable tool directory

## Current Status

**MDX is enabled** for the blog system:
- ✅ File detection and parsing
- ✅ Post interface with extension field
- ✅ 7 interactive components ready
- ✅ Sample MDX post created

## Future Enhancements

To enable the full power of MDX components, future work includes:

1. **Build-time MDX compilation** for proper React component hydration
2. **Component registry** for auto-importing in MDX files
3. **Interactive playground** for testing components
4. **Code examples** for each component

## Conclusion

MDX support is now available in the blog! This enables more engaging and interactive content while maintaining the simplicity of markdown for traditional posts.
