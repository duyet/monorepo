# Interactive MDX Components Showcase

Welcome to the future of technical blogging! This post demonstrates **7 powerful interactive components** that you can use in your MDX posts to create rich, engaging content.

## Why MDX?

MDX allows you to use JSX components directly in your markdown, combining the simplicity of markdown with the power of React components. Perfect for technical tutorials, comparisons, and data visualization.

## 1. ToolComparison

Compare tools with pros, cons, and ratings in a clean card layout.

<ToolComparison
  title="Editor Comparison 2025"
  tools={[
    {
      name: "VS Code",
      pros: ["Huge extension ecosystem", "Excellent IntelliSense", "Free and open source", "Integrated Git tools"],
      cons: ["Memory intensive", "Can be slow with large projects"],
      rating: 4.5
    },
    {
      name: "Neovim",
      pros: ["Extremely fast and lightweight", "Fully customizable", "Terminal-first workflow"],
      cons: ["Steep learning curve", "Requires configuration time"],
      rating: 4.2
    },
    {
      name: "Cursor",
      pros: ["AI-first approach", "Built on VS Code", "Excellent autocomplete"],
      cons: ["Newer platform", "Subscription required for advanced features"],
      rating: 4.3
    }

  headers={["VS Code", "Neovim", "Cursor"]}
  rows={[
    {
      feature: "Performance",
      "VS Code": 6,
      "Neovim": 9,
      "Cursor": 7
    },
    {
      feature: "Customization",
