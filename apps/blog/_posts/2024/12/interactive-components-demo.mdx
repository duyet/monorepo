# Interactive Components Demo

Welcome to the interactive components demonstration! This post showcases all 7 interactive components available with MDX support in our blog.

## 1. Tool Comparison

Here's a comparison of popular development tools:

<ToolComparison
  tools={[
    {
      name: "VS Code",
      pros: ["Extensions ecosystem", "Git integration", "Debugging tools", "Lightweight"],
      cons: ["Can be slow with large files", "Memory usage"],
      rating: 4.5
    },
    {
      name: "IntelliJ IDEA",
      pros: ["Smart code completion", "Refactoring tools", "Database tools"],
      cons: ["Resource heavy", "Paid for Ultimate"],
      rating: 4.2
    },
    {
      name: "Neovim",
      pros: ["Extremely fast", "Highly customizable", "Terminal based"],
      cons: ["Steep learning curve", "Configuration complexity"],
      rating: 4.0
    }
  ]}
/>

## 2. Feature Matrix

The following matrix compares features across different tools with sortable columns:

<FeatureMatrix
  features={[
    {
      name: "Code Intelligence",
      tools: [
        { name: "ToolA", score: 9, color: "blue", shape: "circle" },
        { name: "ToolB", score: 7, color: "green", shape: "square" },
        { name: "ToolC", score: 8, color: "yellow", shape: "triangle" }
      ]
    },
    {
      name: "Debugging",
      tools: [
        { name: "ToolA", score: 8, color: "blue", shape: "circle" },
        { name: "ToolB", score: 9, color: "green", shape: "square" },
        { name: "ToolC", score: 7, color: "yellow", shape: "triangle" }
      ]
    },
    {
      name: "Integration",
      tools: [

        { name: "ToolB", score: 8, color: "green", shape: "square" },
        { name: "ToolC", score: 9, color: "yellow", shape: "triangle" }
      ]
    },
    {
      name: "Performance",
      tools: [

        { name: "ToolC", score: 9, color: "yellow", shape: "triangle" }
      ]
    }
  ]}
/>

## 3. WakaTime Activity Chart

Visualize your coding activity with a beautiful stacked area chart:

<WakaTimeChart
  data={[
    { date: "Mon", coding: 5.2, debugging: 1.8, documentation: 0.8, meetings: 1.2 },
    { date: "Tue", coding: 6.1, debugging: 2.3, documentation: 1.1, meetings: 0.8 },
    { date: "Wed", coding: 4.8, debugging: 1.9, documentation: 0.6, meetings: 1.5 },
    { date: "Thu", coding: 7.2, debugging: 2.1, documentation: 1.3, meetings: 1.0 },
    { date: "Fri", coding: 5.9, debugging: 1.7, documentation: 0.9, meetings: 1.1 },
    { date: "Sat", coding: 3.2, debugging: 0.8, documentation: 0.4, meetings: 0.2 },
    { date: "Sun", coding: 2.1, debugging: 0.5, documentation: 0.2, meetings: 0.1 }
  ]}
/>

## 4. Tool Timeline

Visualize the progression of tools and technologies over time:

<ToolTimeline

  items={[
    {
      title: "Initial Release",
      date: "January 2024",
      description: "First public release with basic features",

      description: "Machine learning powered suggestions",
      status: "planned"
    }
  ]}
/>

## 5. Workflow Diagram

A circular workflow showing the development process:

<WorkflowDiagram
  steps={[
    {
      title: "Plan",

## 6. Version Diff

See what changed between versions in a git-style diff:

<VersionDiff
  oldVersion="v1.2.0"
  newVersion="v2.0.0"
  changes={[
    { type: "removed", line: 45, content: "const oldConfig = legacy.load();" },
    { type: "modified", line: 67, content: "const timeout = 3000; // was: 5000" },
    { type: "added", line: 68, content: "const retryCount = 3;" },
    { type: "modified", line: 89, content: "export function process(data) {" },
    { type: "added", line: 90, content: "  if (!data) throw new Error('No data');" },
    { type: "removed", line: 91, content: "  return oldProcess(data);" },
    { type: "added", line: 92, content: "  return newProcess(data, retryCount);" }
