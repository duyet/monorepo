I'm looking for some alternatives for Docker. Currently, there are a
few of container technologies which are Docker's most direct competitors,
such as rkt, Podman, containerd, ...

I found that Podman just [release the v3.3.0](https://twitter.com/Podman_io/status/1432800271873323010)
that supporting for non-Linux machines, checkpoint/restore, and more.
It's performing much the same role as the Docker engine.
The Podman CLI is the same as Docker CLI. You can simply alias the Docker CLI, `alias docker=podman`.

Docker follows the client/server model, using a daemon to manage all containers under its control.
However, Podman, like rkt and LXC, functions without a central daemon.

I'm not attempting to convince you to use or not to use Podman, especially ocker has
[recently announced](https://www.docker.com/blog/updating-product-subscriptions/)
that Docker Desktop will soon require a paid subscription for Team or Business.
This is just a note if you want to try it on your Mac.

# Install the Podman on Mac

1. Simple by using Homebrew:

```bash
brew install podman
```

2. Initial the Machine for Podman to run from:

```bash
podman machine init
```

3. Start the Machine

```bash
podman machine start
```

4. (Optional) Make the alias as I mention before

```bash
alias docker=podman
```

5. Some configuration to make it work as the same with Docker engine. Although Docker and Podman CLI commands are similar,
   but there are a few issues behind the scenes might hit.

```bash
podman machine ssh
sudo sed -i 's/short-name-mode="enforcing"/short-name-mode="permissive"/g' /etc/containers/registries.conf
```

The `short-name-mode` refers to container images that don't have a full domain name prefixed (e.g. `FROM python:3`, `FROM ubuntu:16`),
which will raise an error on Podman. When using Docker, these images are first prefixed with `docker.io` before being pulled.
With the `short-name-mode=permissive` config, Podman will try all unqualified-search registries in the given order.

Update the `unqualified-search-registries` for your trusted registries:

```
echo 'unqualified-search-registries = ["docker.io", "quay.io"] >> /etc/containers/registries.conf'
```

# Rock in

Run the nginx image and try to connect to the port `8000` on the host machine:

```bash
podman run --rm -it --publish 8000:80 docker.io/library/nginx:latest
```

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000
```

You can use Podman to run rootless containers, compatible with the Docker CLI, 
and it is a powerful container image for running OCI containers.
And I believe it has not worked perfectly out of the box, Podman still has a few bugs compared with Docker, 
but why don't you give it a try to experiment on it.

Anw, you might can try Podman quickly by go to [this url](https://www.katacoda.com/courses/containers-without-docker/running-containers-with-podman)
by Katacode, which offers an interactive environment directly in your browser.
