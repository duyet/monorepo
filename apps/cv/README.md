## Update CV

Currently, it only serves as a website for hosting a PDF CV. We need to replace the latest CV file in the [./public](./public) folder.

## Deploy Your Local Project

To deploy your local project to Vercel, push it to GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket
and [import to Vercel](https://vercel.com/new?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=upstash-roadmap).

**Important**: When you import your project on Vercel, make sure to click on **Environment Variables** and set them to
match your `.env.local` file.
